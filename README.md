# CV-parsing-and-structuring-pipeline-that-extracts-key-details-using-LLMs
This project is a CV parsing and structuring pipeline powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It automatically extracts and organizes key candidate information—such as basic details (name, country, contact, email, education, latest position, and company), languages with proficiency, specialties, and skills—directly from CV files.
In order to try and test this code you need to run a command like this on cli: python main.py (file_path) gpt-4
